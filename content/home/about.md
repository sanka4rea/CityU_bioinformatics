# Research Interest

Our major research interest is to better understand the biology underlying cancer using quantitative approaches. Especially, we have more passion in projects that bridge basic biological studies and clinical research. We have rich experience in integrative analysis of multilevel (epi)genomic data and clinical outcomes for dissecting cancer heterogeneity.
