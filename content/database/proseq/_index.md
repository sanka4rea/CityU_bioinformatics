* A protein sequence database refers to a database that uses computer functions to analyze biological information. Computer algorithms are used to compare DNA and protein sequences to detect evolutionary relationships among structures, functions, and sequences. The sequences of various genomes produce a large amount of DNA sequence data and biological information, and have been applied to study the function of genes to predict previously unknown gene functions.

* Now people's attention is mainly focused on predicting protein structure and function from the only amino acid sequence.
