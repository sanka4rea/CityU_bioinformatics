<p align="justify">**Phenomics** is an area of biology concerned with the measurement of phenomes (a phenome is the set of physical and biochemical traits belonging to a given organism) as they change in response to genetic mutation and environmental influences. It is used in functional genomics, pharmaceutical research, metabolic engineering and increasingly in phylogenetics.

<p align="justify">A key goal of biology is to understand **phenotypic characteristics**, such as health, disease and evolutionary fitness. Phenotypic variation is produced through a complex web of interactions between genotype and environment, and such a 'genotypeâ€“phenotype' map is inaccessible without the detailed phenotypic data that allow these interactions to be studied.
