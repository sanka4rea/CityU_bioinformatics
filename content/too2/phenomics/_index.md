<p align="justify">Metabolomics is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites, the small molelcule intermediates and products of metabolism. Specifically, metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles.

<p align="justify">A key goal of biology is to understand phenotypic characteristics, such as health, disease and evolutionary fitness. Phenotypic variation is produced through a complex web of interactions between genotype and environment, and such a 'genotypeâ€“phenotype' map is inaccessible without the detailed phenotypic data that allow these interactions to be studied.
