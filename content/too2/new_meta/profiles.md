# Metabolic profiles analysis

<p align="justify">The further development of spectroscopic and spectrometric tools for high throughput analyses of selected biochemical pathways is crucial to the acquisition of metabolome data sets of sufficient quality for metabonomics and metabolomics. Whilst metabolic fingerprinting or metabonomics assumes it is not necessary to determine levels of all individual metabolites for classification or response readouts, metabolic profiling or metabolomics absolutely requires the identification and quantification of as broad a class of metabolites as possible.

# MS-based untargeted Metabolomics

<p align="justify">Metabolomics is an emerging field of study in post-genomics, which aims at comprehensive analysis of small organic molecules in biological systems (Patti et al., 2012). Techniques of mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LCâ€“MS) stand out as dominant methods in metabolomic experiments (Dettmer et al., 2007).

# NMR-based Metabolomics/MS-based targeted metabolomics

<p align="justify">Elucidation of the chemical composition of biological samples is a main focus of systems biology and metabolomics. Because nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a rich source of molecular information, it has a unique potential for this task.

<p align="justify">Targeted metabolomics assay platforms are extremely useful for hypothesis testing. These experiments require extensive planning to define the key metabolites in biochemical pathways of interest. Rate-limiting precursors, end-product pools, critical intermediates, and potential alternate precursors or products need to be incorporated into an assay platform.
