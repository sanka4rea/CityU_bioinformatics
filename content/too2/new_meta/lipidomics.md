# Transcription analysis

<p align="justify">**Transcript abundance** is in many ways an extraordinary phenotype, with special attributes that confer particular importance on an understanding of its genetics. The primary transformative potential of genome-wide gene expression genetics is the sheer number of traits — thousands — that can be assayed simultaneously.

# Lipidomics Databases

<p align="justify">Development of databases and the related bioinformatics tools has become an essential part of the omics studies. Over the recent years, empowered by high-throughput technologies for omics fields, the creation of databases devoted to lipids has been undertaken. Consequently, lipid-centered databases have been developed that enable researchers to comfortably analyze lipid species. 

# MS-based untargeted lipidomics

<p align="justify">Due to its sensitivity and selectivity **mass spectrometry** (MS) is the method of choice for qualitative and quantitative lipidomic analysis. Although it is not yet possible to detect and quantify all individual lipids in a given cellular system, the aim of lipidomic analysis is to determine as many individual lipids as possible.
