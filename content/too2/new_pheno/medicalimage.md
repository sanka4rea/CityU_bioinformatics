# Medical Phrnotype Analysis

<p align="justify">**Macroscopic phenotype analysis** deals with all tools usefull for describing, identifying or classifying phenotypes at macroscopic scale. Macroscopic sample can, for example, be plants or mammalians (human, mouse..) imaged by all kinds of macroscopic devices (from medical imaging to basic digital camera).

# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

<p align="justify">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become firmly established as an essential imaging tool. Two characteristics of MRI--its ability to image soft tissue and its avoidance of harmful ionizing radiation--more than compensate for the costs, complexity, safety issues, and patient discomfort associated with it. Today, MRI is the modality of choice for a number of neurological and musculoskeletal indications and is being used for more applications than ever before. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15945465)

<p align="justify">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic medical imaging technique widely used to acquire detailed information about anatomy and function of different organs in the body, in both health and disease. It utilizes electromagnetic fields of three different frequency bands: static magnetic field (SMF), time-varying gradient magnetic fields (GMF) in the kHz range and pulsed radiofrequency fields (RF) in the MHz range.

# Computerized Tomography Scan Imaging (CT)

<p align="justify">Utilization of computed tomography (CT) has increased dramatically over the past several decades. The total number of CT examinations performed annually in the United States has risen from approximately 3 million in 1980 to nearly 70 million in 2007. Integrating CT into routine care has improved patient health care dramatically, and CT is widely considered among the most important advances in medicine.

# Nuclear Medicine Imaging

<p align="justify">Nuclear medicine is a multidisciplinary field that develops and uses instrumentation and tracers (radiopharmaceuticals) to study physiological processes and noninvasively diagnose, stage, and treat diseases. Particularly, it offers a unique means to study cancer biology in vivo and to optimize cancer therapy for individual patients. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22446937)

# Ultrasonic Imaging

<p align="justify">Ultrasonic imaging is a mature and widely used medical diagnostic technology but it is also a field of intense research activity. Innovations are viewed with differing perspectives by the stakeholders- users, industrialists, regulators, and researchers and research funders. The more important recent developments include advances in transducers, scanning schemes, coded excitation, three-dimensional, high-resolution and high-speed imaging, contrast agents, harmonic, elasticity and strain imaging, point-of-care devices, computed tomography, thermoacoustic, photoacoustic, acousto-optic and Hall effect imaging.
