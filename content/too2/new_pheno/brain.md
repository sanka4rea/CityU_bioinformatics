# Connectivity Analysis

<p align="justify">The functional organization of the **brain** is characterized by segregation and integration of information being processed. A central paradigm in modern neuroscience is that anatomical and functional connections between brain regions are organized in a way such that information processing is near optimal. Functional interactions seem to be provided by synchronized activity, both locally and between distant brain regions. Brain networks thus consist of spatially distributed but functionally connected regions that process information. [Source](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2012/412512/)

# Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

<p align="justify">The relationship between **brain structure and function** has been one of the centers of research in neuroimaging for decades. In recent years, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques have been widely available and popular in cognitive and clinical neurosciences for examining the brain's white matter (WM) micro-structures and gray matter (GM) functions, respectively.
