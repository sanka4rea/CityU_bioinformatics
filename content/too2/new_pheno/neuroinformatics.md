<p align="justify">**Modelling in computational neuroscience** is becoming a crucial tool for understanding how experimentally observed properties of neural systems emerge from lower-level biophysical processes. In the same way that processing of information happens at multiple physical scales in the nervous system, software applications have been created which specialize in modelling different aspects of neurons and networks.
