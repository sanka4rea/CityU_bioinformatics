# Immune System Analysis

<p align="justify">**Immunoinformatics** involves the application of computational methods to immunological problems. Prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes has long been the focus of immunoinformatics, given the potential translational implications, and many tools have been developed. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, an unprecedented wealth of information has become available that requires more-advanced immunoinformatics tools. Based on information from whole-genome sequencing, exome sequencing and RNA sequencing, it is possible to characterize with high accuracy an individual’s human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotype (i.e., the individual set of HLA alleles of the patient), as well as changes arising in the HLA ligandome (the collection of peptides presented by the HLA) owing to genomic variation. This has allowed new opportunities for translational applications of epitope prediction, such as epitope-based design of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, and personalized cancer immunotherapies.

# Flow Cytometry

<p align="justify">**Flow cytometry** is a technology widely used in clinical practice and in research, particularly in the field of immunology. It is capable of interrogating a wide variety of markers on many different cell types on a single-cell basis, using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. Although molecular as well as genomic studies have advanced the understanding of immunological processes and autoimmune diseases, the components of the human immune system and their functions have yet to be comprehensively described. Without such a reference “catalog” of the immune system, it is ultimately difficult to interpret the pathogenic significance of genetic, molecular, or phenotypic variants observed in diseases.
