# Protein Sequence Analysis

<p align="justify">Protein sequence analysis tools are used to predict specific functions, activities, origin, or localization of proteins based on their amino-acid sequence. Software tools are also used to analysis high-throughput proteomics data sequences obtained by mass-spectrometry.

# MS-based (Mass Spectrometry) untargeted Proteomics

A number of technologies can be used to study proteomes, but arguably none is more powerful than mass spectrometry. There are two fundamentally different MS-based strategies for analyzing proteomes: discovery-based identification and targeted quantification ([Doerr, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23547294); [Picotti and Aebersold, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22669653)). With a discovery-based strategy, the goal is usually to identify as many proteins as possible. The goal of a targeted proteomics experiment is to monitor a select few proteins of interest with high sensitivity, reproducibility and quantitative accuracy.
