# Transcription analysis

<p align="justify">Transcript abundance is in many ways an extraordinary phenotype, with special attributes that confer particular importance on an understanding of its genetics. The primary transformative potential of genome-wide gene expression genetics is the sheer number of traits — thousands — that can be assayed simultaneously.

## Prognostic Biomarker Identification

## Region Discrimination

## Gene co-expression prediction

## Gene regulatory network inference

## Gene set enrichment analysis

## Over-representation analysisi

# RNA-seq analysis

<p align="justify">RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) also known as whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (WTSS) is the next-generation sequencing technology to study the transcriptome. It could be used as an alternative to microarrays for gene expression analysis, without the need to know the RNA sequence a priori. RNA-seq offers more accurate data and applications including detection of gene fusion, variants, alternative splicing, post-transcriptional modifications as well as for analysis of small RNAs such as tRNA or miRNA profiles. A complete picture of the RNA content can be obtained from low quantity biological samples. Several analytical steps are critical for a successful characterization and quantification of the transcriptome. A large list of bioinformatic tools is proposed here for quality control, data processing, quantification, annotation and visualization as well as for interpretation and biological network analysis for understanding RNA-seq data.

## Read count

## Known transcript quantification

## Gene fusion detection

## Prognostic biomarker identification

## Differential expression

## Alternative splicing events identification

#  CAGE Analysis

<p align="justify">Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) provides accurate high-throughput measurement of RNA expression. By the large-scale analysis of 5' end of transcripts using CAGE method, it enables not only determination of the transcription start site but also prediction of promoter region.

## TSS detection 

## De novo motif discovery

# Gene expression array analysis

<p align="justify">Gene expression microarray is a very powerful high-throughput tool capable of monitoring the expression of thousands of genes in an organism simultaneously. The power of these tools has been applied to a range of applications, including discovering novel disease subtypes, developing new diagnostic tools, and identifying underlying mechanisms of disease or drug response. However, this technology necessarily produces a large amount of data, challenging us to interpret it by exploiting modern computational and statistical tools.

## Time course

## Meta-analysis

# Metatranscriptomic sequencing analysis

Metatranscriptomics is the analysis of the RNA transcripts being expressed by a community at a given point of time

## Prediction-base Taxonomic

## Homology-Based Taxonomic
