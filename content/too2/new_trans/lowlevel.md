# DNA modification analysis

<p align="justify">Whole genome DNA methylation detection is one of the most important part of epigenetics research. It is supposed to have a great effect on cancers and tumors, and even be involved in the senility of human. In addition, it is believed that in medical aspects, DNA methylation may have a strong relationship with diabetes and immunological diseases (Jeong et al., 2014; Hackett et al., 2013; Duthie, 2011). 

# Low-level RNA detection

# scRNA-seq analysis

<p align="justify">The development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at the single-cell level has already led to profound new discoveries in biology, ranging from the identification of novel cell types to the study of global patterns of stochastic gene expression. Alongside the technological breakthroughs that have facilitated the large-scale generation of single-cell transcriptomic data, it is important to consider the specific computational and analytical challenges that still have to be overcome. Although some tools for analysing RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be readily applied to single-cell RNA-seq data, many new computational strategies are required to fully exploit this data type and to enable a comprehensive yet detailed study of gene expression at the single-cell level.
