#  CLIP-seq Analysis

<p align="justify">Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation associated to **high-throughput sequencing** (CLIP-seq) is a technique used to identify RNA directly bound to RNA-binding proteins across the entire transcriptome in cell or tissue samples. Recent technological and computational advances permit the analysis of many CLIP-seq samples simultaneously, allowing us to reveal the comprehensive network of RNA-protein interaction and to integrate it to other genome-wide analyses. Therefore, the design and quality management of the CLIP-seq analyses are of critical importance to extract clean and biological meaningful information from CLIP-seq experiments. The application of CLIP-seq technique to Argonaute 2 (Ago2) protein, the main component of the microRNA (miRNA)-induced silencing complex, reveals the direct binding sites of miRNAs, thus providing insightful information about the role played by miRNA(s).

# Ribo-seq Analysis

<p align="justify">Genome-wide analyses of gene expression have so far focused on the abundance of mRNA species as measured either by microarray or, more recently, by RNA sequencing. However, neither approach provides information on protein synthesis, which is the true end point of gene expression. **Ribosome profiling** is an emerging technique that uses deep sequencing to monitor in vivo translation. Studies using ribosome profiling have already provided new insights into the identity and the amount of proteins that are produced by cells, as well as detailed views into the mechanism of protein synthesis itself.
