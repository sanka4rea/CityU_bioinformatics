# RNA Modifications Analysis

<p align="justify">From a biosynthetic point of view, the roughly 100 known different RNA nucleotide modifications can be easily divided according to their complexity. There are simple chemical transformations, such as addition of a methyl group or bond isomerization of uridine to yield pseudouridine, and there are more complex multistep transformations involving the action of several enzymes in a defined order.

# Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing Data Analysis (MeRIP-seq Analysis)

RNA modifications, especially methylation of the N6 position of adenosine (m6A), represent an emerging research frontier in RNA biology. Along with the development of MeRIP-Seq ([Meyer et al., 2012](https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(12)00536-3)) also called m6A-seq ([Dominissini et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575960)), researchers are knowable to carry out in-depth studies on m6A distribution and function of related genes.
