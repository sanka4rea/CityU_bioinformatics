<p align="justify">Population genomics is the large-scale comparison of DNA sequences of populations. Population genomics is a neologism that is associated with population genetics. Population genomics studies genome-wide effects to improve our understanding of microevolution so that we may learn the phylogenetic history and demography of a population.

# Popilation Genetic Analysis

<p align="justify">Genetic diversity is the amount of variation observed between DNA sequences from distinct individuals of a given species. This pivotal concept of population genetics has implications for species health, domestication, management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation, and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology versus population history, are still largely mysterious.

## Population Structure Inference

# Genotyping by Sequencing data analysis (GBS Analysis) 

<p align="justify">Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is a next generation sequencing based method that takes advantage of reduced representation to enable high throughput genotyping of large numbers of individuals at a large number of SNP markers. The relatively straightforward, robust, and cost-effective GBS protocol is currently being applied in numerous species by a large number of researchers.

# Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing Data Analysis (RAD-seq Analysis) 

<p align="justify">RAD markers were first implemented using microarrays (Miller et al., 2007) and later adapted for NGS (Baird et al., 2008). RAD-seq could generate a genome-wide density of genetic markers. RAD-seq has been used to study population differentiation and selection (Emerson et al., 2010; Hohenlohe et al., 2011).
