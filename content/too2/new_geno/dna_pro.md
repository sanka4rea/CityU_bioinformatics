<p align="justify">DNA-binding proteins are proteins that have DNA-binding domains and thus have a specific or general affinity for single- or double-stranded DNA. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins generally interact with the major groove of B-DNA, because it exposes more functional groups that identify a base pair. However, there are some known minor groove DNA-binding ligands such as netropsin, distamycin, Hoechst 33258, pentamidine, DAPI and others.

<p align="justify">Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), first described in 2007 (Barski et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2007; Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Robertson et al., 2007), allows in vivo determination of where a protein binds the genome, which can be transcription factors, DNA-binding enzymes, histones, chaperones, or nucleosomes (Park, 2009; Furey, 2012).
