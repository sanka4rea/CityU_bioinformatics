<p align="justify">Metabolomics is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites, the small molelcule intermediates and products of metabolism. Specifically, metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles.

<p align="justify">Metabolomics can generally be deﬁned as the study of global metabolite proﬁles in a system (cell, tissue or organism) under a given set of conditions.
