### [Rfam](http://rfam.xfam.org/) 

**Rfam** is a database containing information about non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families and other structured RNA elements. It is an annotated, open access database originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with Janelia Farm, and currently hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute. <br>Rfam is designed to be similar to the Pfam database for annotating protein families.

### [MiRBase](http://www.mirbase.org/) 

In bioinformatics, **miRBase** is a biological database that acts as an archive of microRNA sequences and annotations. As of September 2010 it contained information about 15,172 microRNAs. This number has rose to 38589 by March 2018. The miRBase registry provides a centralised system for assigning new names to microRNA genes.
