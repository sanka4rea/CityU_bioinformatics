<p align="justify">These databases collect **genome sequences**, annotate and analyze them, and provide public access. Some add curation of experimental literature to improve computed annotations. These databases may hold many species genomes, or a single [model organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism) genome.

### [Bioinformatic Harvester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatic_Harvester) 

<p align="justify">The **Bioinformatic Harvester** was a bioinformatic meta search engine created by the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Molecular_Biology_Laboratory) and subsequently hosted and further developed by KIT [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](org/wiki/European_Molecular_Biology_Laboratory) and subsequently hosted and further developed by KIT ) for genes and protein-associated information.

### [Gene Disease Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Disease_Database) 

In Bioinformatics, a **Gene Disease Database** is a systematized collection of data, typically structured to model aspects of reality, in a way to comprehend the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases, by understanding multiple composite interactions between phenotype-genotype relationships and gene-disease mechanisms.

### [SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia) 

**SNPedia** (pronounced "snipedia") is a wiki-based bioinformatics web site that serves as a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

### [Ensembl genome database project](http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html)

**Ensembl genome database project** is a joint scientific project between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, which was launched in 1999 in response to the imminent completion of the Human Genome Project.

### [Flybase](http://flybase.org/)

A Database of **Drosophila** Genes & Genomes

### [Xenbase](http://www.xenbase.org/entry/)

**Xenbase** is a Model Organism Database (MOD), providing informatics resources, as well as genomic and biological data on Xenopus frogs.

### [Saccharomyces Genome Database](https://www.yeastgenome.org/)

The **Saccharomyces Genome Database** is a scientific database of the molecular biology and genetics of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is commonly known as baker's or budding yeast.

### [WormBase](https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5)

**WormBase** is an online biological database about the biology and genome of the nematode model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and contains information about other related nematodes.

### [Zebrafish Information Network](http://zfin.org/)

The **Zebrafish Information Network** (ZFIN) is an online biological database of information about the zebrafish (Danio rerio).

### [Personal Genome Project](http://www.personalgenomes.org/)

The **Personal Genome Project** (PGP) is a long term, large cohort study which aims to sequence and publicize the complete genomes and medical records of 100,000 volunteers, in order to enable research into personal genomics and personalized medicine.
