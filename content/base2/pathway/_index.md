## Signal Transduction Pathway Databases

Signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events, most commonly protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases, which ultimately results in a cellular response.

### [Pathway Interaction Database (PID)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686461/)

<p align="justify">The **Pathway Interaction Database** (PID) is a free biomedical database of human cellular signaling pathways. The database contains information about the molecular interactions and reactions that take place in cells, with a particular focus on processes that might be relevant to cancer research and treatment.

### [Reactome](https://twitter.com/reactome)

**Reactome** is a free online database of biological pathways. There are several Reactomes that concentrate on specific organisms, the largest of these is focused on human biology, the following description concentrates on the human Reactome.

## Metabolic Pathway  Databases

<p align="justify">In biochemistry, a **metabolic pathway** is a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell. The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.[1]:26 In most cases a metabolic pathway, the product of one enzyme acts as the substrate for the next. However, set products are considered waste and removed from the cell. These enzymes often require dietary minerals, vitamins, and other cofactors to function.
