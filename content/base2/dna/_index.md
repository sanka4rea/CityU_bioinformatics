# Primary Databases

International Nucleotide Sequence Database (INSD) consists of the following databases.

### [DDBJ](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html) 

**DNA Data Bank of Japan** (DDBJ) provides sharing and analysis services for data from life science researches and advances science.

### [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/) 

**European Bioinformatics Institute** (EMBL) is a molecular biology research institution supported by 22 member states, four prospect and two associate member states.

### [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) 

**National Center for Biotechnology Information** (GenBank) is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences.

<p align="justify">The three databases, DDBJ (Japan), GenBank (USA) and European Nucleotide Archive (Europe), are repositories for nucleotide sequence data from all organisms. All three databases accept nucleotide sequence submissions, and then exchange new and updated data on a daily basis to achieve optimal synchronisation between them. These three databases are primary databases, as they house original sequence data. They collaborate with [Sequence Read Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_Read_Archive) (SRA), which archives raw reads from high-throughput sequencing instruments.

# Secondary Databases

### [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/)

The **Reference Sequence** (RefSeq) database[1] is an open access, annotated and curated collection of publicly available nucleotide sequences (DNA, RNA) and their protein products.

### [OMIM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim)

OMIM is **Online Mendelian Inheritance in Manauthored** and edited at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine.

### [HapMap](https://www.genome.gov/10001688/)

The **International HapMap Project** was an organization that aimed to develop a **haplotype map** (HapMap) of the human genome, to describe the common patterns of human genetic variation.

### [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/en-int/)

**23andMe** is a privately held personal genomics and biotechnology company based in Mountain View, California. The company is named for the 23 pairs of **chromosomes** in a normal human cell.
