<p align="justify">The series of BIBE Conferences was found in 2000 and BIBE is the first leading Conference of its kind in IEEE/Internationally inspiring others to follow its path. The annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering aims at building synergy between Bioinformatics and Bioengineering/Biomedical, two complementary disciplines that hold great promise for the advancement of research and development in complex medical and biological systems, agriculture, environment, public health, drug design. Research and development in these two areas are impacting the science and technology in fields such as medicine, food production, forensics, etc. by advancing fundamental concepts in molecular biology, by helping us understand living organisms at multiple levels, by developing innovative implants and bio-prosthetics, and by improving tools and techniques for the detection, prevention and treatment of diseases.
