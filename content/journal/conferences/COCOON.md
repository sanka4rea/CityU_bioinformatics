<p align="justify"> Original research papers in the areas of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity, and combinatorics related to computing are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, they are particularly interested in submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting.

<p align="justify">All the papers will be published to the symposium in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes. Papers of high quality will be invited to special issues of Algorithmica, Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), and Journal of Combinatorial Optimization (JOCO), respectively.
