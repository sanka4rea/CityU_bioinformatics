<p align="justify">International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB) is the annual conference of Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet) that showcases the latest research and technologies in all areas of bioinformatics. Since 2002, InCoB has been attended by practitioners from both biology fields and computing backgrounds in the Asia-Pacific region, and also from other regions.

<p align="justify">Originally organised by coordination between the Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet) and the Thailand National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC) in 2002, the meeting has since been the flagship conference of the APBioNet, where APBioNet's Annual General Meeting is held.

<p align="justify">As in the past, accepted papers will be published in international, peer-reviewed journals, such as Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics, BMC Genomics, BMC Medical Genomics, BMC Systems Biology, and IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB).
