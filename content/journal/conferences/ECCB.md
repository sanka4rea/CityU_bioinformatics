<p align="justify">It is the main computational biology event in Europe and will welcome scientists working in a variety of disciplines, including bioinformatics, computational biology, biology, medicine, and systems biology. Participating in ECCB will be the perfect opportunity to keep pace with cutting edge research, and to network with members of ECCB community.

<p align="justify">The conference covers computational methods for molecular biology that arise in the context of genomics and proteomics technologies in the fields of molecular biology, molecular medicine and pharmaceutics. Biological areas of interest include molecular sequence analysis, phylogenetics and evolution, molecular structure, molecular docking and drug design, metabolic and regulatory networks, gene expression and regulation, gene and protein function, modeling of cellular processes, and analysis of genetic variations. Computational methods covered in the conference include machine learning, pattern recognition, knowledge representation, databases, combinatorial optimization, stochastic modeling, string and graph algorithms, computer linguistics, robotics, constraint satisfaction and parallel computation. 

<p align="justify">With its partner conference series RECOMB and ISMB, the ECCB conference series is one of the major international conference series in bioinformatics.
