<p align="justify">Launched in 1995, Genome Research is an international, continuously published, peer-reviewed journal that publishes studies on the structure, function, biology, and evolution of genomes of all organisms, with a long-standing emphasis on genome-scale analyses, chromatin structure and function, epigenomics, systems genetics, and proteomics. They also feature gene discoveries that provide novel insights and reports of high-throughput experimental and computational approaches.

In addition to these core areas, the journal is now particularly interested in the following areas:
comprehensive characterization of genome sequence variation

1. understanding the basis of phenotypic complexity

2. network biology and the functional effects of genetic variation

3. evolutionary mechanisms of species origin, adaptation, and genomic diversity, including the study of ancient DNA

4. genomic medicine, including mechanisms of penetrance, expressivity, and modifier effects

5. understanding genomic and biological processes through single-cell analyses

6. novel computational algorithms that provide insight into biological processes

7. genome editing and engineering
