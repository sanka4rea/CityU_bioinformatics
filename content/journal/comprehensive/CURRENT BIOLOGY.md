<p align="justify">Current Biology is a general journal that publishes original research across all areas of biology together with an extensive and varied set of editorial sections. A primary aim of the journal is to foster communication across fields of biology, both by publishing important findings of general interest from diverse fields and through highly accessible editorial articles that explicitly aim to inform non-specialists.

Current Biology publishes papers reporting findings in any area of biology that have sufficient claim to be of general interestâ€”this could be, for example, because the advance is important for a specific field, or because it is intrinsically of wide interest to biologists generally. We have several formats for publishing original research (Articles, Reports, and Correspondences); see our Information for Authors for details.
