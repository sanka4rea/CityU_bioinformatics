<p align="justify">Nature Protocols is an online journal of high-quality peer-reviewed protocols for researchers. Protocols are commissioned by the editors or submitted by authors as Presubmission Enquiries. They are presented in a 'recipe' style, providing step-by-step descriptions of procedures that users can take to the lab and immediately apply in their own research. All protocols have been proven to work already, having been used to generate data reported in published research papers.Their scope covers all areas of the biological and biomedical sciences, including methods grounded in physics and chemistry with biological applications. Protocols can be accessed by searching or browsing the site.

<p align="justify">Nature Protocols is associated with the Protocol Exchange, an open-access online repository for protocols, which is completely free to use (no article-processing fee). Authors upload protocols, which are assigned a DOI for citation purposes and published under a CC-BY licence. They are not peer reviewed or edited. Protocols can be linked to any publications in which they are used. You can also establish a dedicated page to collect all the Protocols used in your lab.
