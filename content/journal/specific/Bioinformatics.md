<p align="justify">Bioinformatics is the leading journal in its field, Bioinformatics publishes the highest quality scientific papers and review articles of interest to academic and industrial researchers. It is a biweekly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering research and software in computational biology. It is the official journal of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), together with PLOS Computational Biology. 

<img src="/img/journal/spec/bioinformatics.jpg" width = "440" height = "576" alt="bioinf" align=center />

<p align="justify">Its main focus is on new developments in genome bioinformatics and computational biology. Two distinct sections within the journal - Discovery Notes and Application Notes - focus on shorter papers; the former reporting biologically interesting discoveries using computational methods, the latter exploring the applications used for experiments.
