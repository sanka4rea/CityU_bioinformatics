<p align="justify">Briefings in Bioinformatics is an international forum for researchers and educators in the life sciences. The journal will also be of interest to mathematicians, statisticians and computer scientists who apply their work to biological problems. The journal publishes reviews for the users of databases and analytical tools of contemporary genetics, molecular and systems biology and is unique in providing practical help and guidance to the non-specialist in computerized methodology. Papers range in scope and depth, from the introductory level to specific details of protocols and analyses encompassing bacterial, plant, fungal, animal and human data.
