<p align="justify">Topics include: 
• Genomics 
• Mathematical modeling and simulation 
• Distributed and parallel biological computing 
• Designing biological databases 
• Pattern matching and pattern detection 
• Linking disparate databases and data 
• New tools for computational biology 
• Relational and object-oriented database technology for bioinformatics

<p align="justify">Since 1997, authors of accepted proceedings papers at the Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB) conference have been invited to submit a revised version to a special issue of the journal
