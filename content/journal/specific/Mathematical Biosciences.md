<p align="justify">This leading international journal publishes research and expository papers on the formulation, analysis and solution of mathematical models in the biosciences. 

<img src="/img/journal/spec/mathbio.jpg" width = "440" height = "576" alt="mathbio" align=center />

<p align="justify">The journal serves both mathematicians involved in solving model equations or in reaching conclusions that are testable in the real world, and biologists who are interested in forming mathematical models of biological processes and systems.
