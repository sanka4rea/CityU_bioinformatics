<p align="justify">Journal of Mathematical Biology is a peer-reviewed, mathematics journal, published by Springer Verlag. Founded in 1974, the journal publishes articles on mathematical biology. It is the official journal of the European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology.

<p align="justify">The aim of the Journal of Mathematical Biology is, on the one hand, to foster the contribution of mathematical modelling and reasoning to the understanding of biological systems and the explanation of biological phenomena, and, on the other hand, to be a forum for the presentation of biologically inspired problems of a mathematical nature. 

<p align="justify">Consequently, papers should either provide biological insight as a result of mathematical analysis or identify and open up challenging new types of mathematical problems that derive from biological knowledge (in the form of data, or theory, or simulation results). Mathematical ideas, methods, techniques and results are welcome provided they show sufficient potential for usefulness in a biological context.
