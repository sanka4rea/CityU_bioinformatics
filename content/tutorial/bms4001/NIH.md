### Program Goals

<p align="justify">Readily Available Data Collection Tools and Research Protocols.

* Rapid response clinical and epidemiologic research for disasters
* Field tested, IRB and OMB approved tools and protocols
* Implementation guidance, forms, and participant tracking information
* Hosted on publicly accessible NLM website. Records describing data collection tools are now available.

<p align="justify">Environmental Health Research Response Network.

* NIEHS intramural/extramural researchers, centers, grantees, and academic partners
* Engaged in the development and prioritization of the system and tools
* Trained research responders who are familiar with data collection tools, protocols, and can deploy in a disaster
* Listing of subject matter and information experts that can be called upon for assistance

<p align="justify">Coordination and Integration with Disaster Response and Recovery Infrastructure

* Multi-stakeholder engagement and information sharing
* Training exercises for research responders and partners
* Disaster Research Response Workshop
* Facilitate state and local environmental health research response capabilities regardless of federal disaster declarations or efforts


### Sustainment of Program

After proving the utility of this program, DR2 aims to:

1. Expand Portfolio Analysis to all of Health and Human Services (HHS)
2. Continue funding the program
3. Expand the website and databases
