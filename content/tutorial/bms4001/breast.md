<p align="justify">The [**Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool**](https://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/) is an interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to estimate a woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer. 

Breast cancer: malignant tumor cells originates from the breast that attacks the nearby healthy tissue, and it can spread outside to the other tissue.

Breast cancer is fatal,  it can spread to the lymph nodes,lungs and brain by metastasis, harm the functions of the organ and progressively loses its function.

However, breast cancer can be treated easily if diagnosed in an early stage, it can:

* Increase survival rate 
* Reduce medical cost
* Avoid extensive treatment (psychological and physical impact)

### Functionalities

* Estimate  womanâ€™s risk of developing invasive breast cancer at > 35 years old. <br>1. Personal medical history. <br>2. Her reproductive history. <br>3. History of breast cancer among her first-degree relatives  

* Total 11 questions designed for calculating the risk
* Use The Gail model. <br>1.Has been tested in large populations of white women.<br>2.Shown to provide accurate estimates of breast cancer risk.
* System will be updated when new data and research are available.

### Limitations

1. <p align="justify">Calculate the risk of invasive breast cancer is not accurate for women with a history of DCIS or LCIS. 
2. <p align="justify">The tool cannot accurately predict the risk of another breast cancer for women who have a medical history of breast cancer.
