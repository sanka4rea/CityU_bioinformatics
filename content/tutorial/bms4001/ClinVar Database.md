<p align="justify">[**ClinVar**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. 

* Provides reports of the relationship among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence
* Submission driven
* Submission of data can be from: 1. Clinical and research laboratories. 2. Locus specific databases. 3. Authors of publications

### Functionalities of ClinVar

<p align="justify">Facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation + observed health status.

1. <p align="justify">**An archive:**<br>Provides accessioned and versioned reports → Relationships among human variation + human phenotypes with attribution to sources and publications.
2. <p align="justify">**A reporter:**<br>Submitted interpretations; Review status of a report of clinical significance; Evidence of genotype/phenotype relationship; Standard terminology and usage.
3. <p align="justify">**An aggregator:**<br>Reports related information from Gene, RefSeq, dbSNP and phenotype databases etc.
4. <p align="justify">**A data service:**<br>Provides interactive and programmatic access to current + previous records.

### Examples of application of ClinVar

1. <p align="justify">**Location search:**<br>Search a DNA or protein location → For what is known about the clinical significance of a sequence variation.
2. <p align="justify">**Review evidence about a variation:**<br>Look for evidence for/against a phenotype that associate with an allele → Allow determination/recalculation of variant’s pathogenicity.
3. <p align="justify">**Integration into testers’ workflow:**<br>Clinical laboratories integrate information from ClinVar into their workflow → Use the information to identify clinical significance of already documented variants.
