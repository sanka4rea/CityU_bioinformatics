<p align="justify">The [**Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool**](https://www.cancer.gov/colorectalcancerrisk/Default.aspx) was designed for use by doctors and other health providers with their patients. If you are not a health provider, take these results to your doctor or other health provider to discuss your personal risk of colorectal cancer. (Colorectal cancer is another way to say colon and rectal cancer). 

This tool can estimate the risk of colorectal cancer for men and women who are:

* Between the ages of 50 and 85
* African American
* Asian American/Pacific Islander
* Hispanic/Latino
* White

This tool does not yet apply to American Indians and Alaska Natives, but we are working to improve the tool for use by these groups of people.

If you are African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino, please click [here](https://www.cancer.gov/colorectalcancerrisk/def-other-races.aspx) for more information about race, ethnicity, and how we developed this tool.

This tool cannot accurately estimate risk of colorectal cancer for people who have the following problems:

* Ulcerative colitis
* Crohn disease
* Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
* Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch Syndrome
* Personal history of colorectal cancer

### Problems

* Cannot estimate risk for recurrence
* Cannot estimate risk for the following problems:<br>Ulcerative colitis – inflammation. <br>Crohn disease – inflammation. <br>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) – genetic. <br>Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), aka Lynch Syndrome – genetic.
