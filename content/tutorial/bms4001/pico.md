<p align="justify">The [**PICO**](https://pubmedhh.nlm.nih.gov/nlmd/pico/piconew.php) is a technique used in evidence based practice to frame and answer a clinical or health care related question. The PICO framework is also used to develop literature search strategies. The PICO acronym stands for

* P – patient, problem or population
* I – intervention
* C – comparison, control or comparator[5]
* O – outcome

### evidence-based medicine (EBM)
<p align="justify">The paradigm of evidence-based medicine (EBM) recommends that physicians formulate clinical questions in terms of the problem/population, intervention, comparison, and outcome.

**5 Steps of EBM:**

1. Ask question.
2. Search
3. Critically appraise
4. Implement
5. Evaluate

**Advantages of EBM:**

* Helps clinicians stay current on standardized, evidence-based protocols.
* Uses near real-time data to make care decisions.
* Improves transparency, accountability, and value.
* Improves quality of care.
* Improves outcomes.

### Introduction of P.I.C.O

**PATIENT OR PROBLEM**

* What are the patient's demographics such as age, gender and ethnicity?
* what is the or problem type?
* How would you describe a group of patients similar to yours?
* What are the most important characteristics of the patient?
* Example: Work-related neck muscle pain

**INTERVENTION, EXPOSURE, PROGNOSTIC FACTOR**

* Which main intervention, prognostic factor, or exposure am I considering?
* What type of intervention is being considered?
* Is this a medication of some type, or exercise, or rest?
* Example: Strength training of the painful muscle

**COMPARISON OR CONTROL**

* What is the main alternative to compare with the intervention?
* Is there a camparison treatment to be considered?
* The comparison may be with another medication, another form of treatment such as exercise or no treatment
* Example: Rest

**OUTCOME**

* What can I hope to accomplish, measure, improve, or affect?
* What would be the desired effect you would like to see?
* What effects are not wanted?
* Are there any side effects involved with this form of testing or treatment?
* Example: Pain relief

**How to use** and **Case Study** could be found in **the student project**.
