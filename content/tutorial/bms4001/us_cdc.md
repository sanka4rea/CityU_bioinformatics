<p align="justify">[**US CDC FluView Interactive**](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). The CDC FluView report provides weekly influenza surveillance information in the United States. These applications were developed to enhance the weekly FluView report by better facilitating communication about influenza with the public health community, clinicians, scientists, and the general public. This series of dynamic visualizations allow any Internet user to access influenza information collected by CDC’s monitoring systems. 

### Background

* HK is now in the winter surge of influenza. With sporadic outbreaks of influenza in the community, institutions and schools
* As a contagious respiratory illness, the outbreak of influenza arouse attention not restricted to HK
* In the US, to keep track of the outbreak of flu.
* WHO & National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories collaborated→ provide Influenza surveillance data from the 1997-1998 on FluView Interactive.

### What is FluView Interactive

1. Influenza surveillance database. <br>provides weekly influenza surveillance information in the U.S. <br> allow any Internet user to access influenza information collected by CDC’s monitoring systems.
2. Gathers and displays the data collected by <br>the WHO/NREVSS Collaborating Labs. <br>Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet)
3. Provides influenza information in flu season & geography (national, regional, or selected states) on:<br>both influenza laboratory data. <br>medically attended visits for influenza-like illness (ILI).

### Functionalities 

* Find out the area and period of influenza activity 
* Track influenza-related illness
* Determine the type of influenza viruses are circulating
* Detect changes in influenza viruses
* Measure the impact of influenza on hospitalizations and deaths
* Provides information about influenza, related vaccines, and preventive measures

<p align="justify">Facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation + observed health status.

### What, and who, this tool is useful for

**General Public**

* Providing some basic information about influenza.<br>e.g. flu seasons as well as flu management and prevention 

**Doctors**

* <p align="justify">Offering appropriate treatment of, and more information on, the flu to patients (using the different scientific studies provided and their own knowledge)

**The Government and Researchers**

* Ruling out influenza outbreak by predicting the next influenza virus that could cause the most illness
* Raising awareness of flu protection in the public health community

<br>
**How to use** and **Case Study** could be found in **the student work** below.
