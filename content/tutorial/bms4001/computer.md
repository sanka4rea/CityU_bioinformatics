<p align="justify">The history of [**Computer**](http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/). This part will briefly introduce the history of computer. 

### What is computer?

* The word ‘Computer‘ is come from the word ‘compute’ which means to calculate.
* In the the early 17th century, computer is a job position that a person performing mathematical calculation for the company.
* This position is lately replaced by electronic computer.
* when the electronic computer are commerically available.

### The usage of computer

A computer is a electronic machine that help you: 

* Accepts data
* Processes data 
* Produce output 
* Store the results.

<p align="justify">The computer was born not for entertainment or email but out of a need to solve a serious number-crunching crisis. By 1880, the U.S. population had grown so large that it took more than seven years to tabulate the U.S. Census results. The government sought a faster way to get the job done, giving rise to punch-card based computers that took up entire rooms.

<p align="justify">Today, we carry more computing power on our smartphones than was available in these early models. The following brief history of computing is a timeline of how computers evolved from their humble beginnings to the machines of today that surf the Internet, play games and stream multimedia in addition to crunching numbers.
