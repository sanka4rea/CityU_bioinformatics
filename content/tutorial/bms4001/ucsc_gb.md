<p align="justify">[ **UCSC Genome Browser** ](https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html) is a web-based tool that provides a fast, easy way to display a specific region of a genome assembly, along with dozens of aligned annotation tracks. 

<p align="justify">The browser features data from a large collection of vertebrates, model organisms, and selected invertebrate genomes.

* Rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of genomes.
* Dozens of aligned annotation tracks show together.
* Tracks can be hidden, collapsed into a condensed or full display according to the user's criteria.
* Rapid visual correlation of different types of information.
* Zooming and rolling controls help to narrow or broaden the displayed chromosomal range to focus on the exact region of interest. 
* Half of the annotation tracks are computed at UCSC from publicly available sequence data. 
* The remaining tracks are provided by worldwide. 
* Users can add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes.

### Genome Assembly

<p align="justify">**Genome:** entire genetic materials contain in an individual cell of organism

Human genome: diploid genome, 46 chromosomes, also genetic materials in mitochondria

Genome assembly: set of chromosomes, unlocalized scaffolds, unplaced scaffolds, alternate sequences that represent an organismâ€™s genome

### Gap

To measure  length of genome: count no. of base pair

<p align="justify">Normally, redundant regions will be deleted with assist of layering sequencing information over a physical map to combine scaffold information. However, this make gaps, appear and  making sequence longer than typical base pair assembly. Redundant regions: haplotypes & pseudoautosomal regions
