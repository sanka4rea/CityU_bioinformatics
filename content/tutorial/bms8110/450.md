### Microarray Profile Datasets Screening

<p align="justify">**Keywords in GEO:** ((HCC) OR (liver cancer) OR (hepatoma) OR (liver carcinoma) OR (hepatocellular carcinoma)) AND microarray.

Inclusion cretiria: 
1. equal number of non-cancerous liver tissue and HCC samples; 
2. pathologically confirmed
3. ethical approval + written informed consents 
4. the number of samples for each histological group should be > 8
5. discovery and validation sets should not have overlaps

**Discovery set (GSE84402):** 28 in total = 14 HCC + 14 non-cancerous liver

**Validation set (GSE29721):** 20 in total = 10 HCC + 10 non-cancerous liver

### Differentially Expressed Genes

Data Preparation - Preprocessing - Quality Control-  Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Initial hypothesis: a number of genes are down-regulated in HCC tissues as compared with non-cancerous liver tissues.

Discovery Set:

* Down-regulated (adjusted P-value < 0.05; logFC > 0): 1699 
* Up-regulated (adjusted P-value < 0.05; logFC < 0): 2028

Validation Set:

* Down-regulated (adjusted P-value < 0.05; logFC > 0): 1590 
* Up-regulated (adjusted P-value < 0.05; logFC < 0): 2640 

### Hypothesis: in silico Validation 

Discovery Set:

The most significant down-regulated genes (adjusted P-value < 0.05; logFC > 2): 172

Validation Set:

Down-regulated (adjusted P-value < 0.05; logFC > 0): 1590 

**Overlaps: 147 (82.56%)**

### GSOA+GSEA

GO_MF+GO_BP+GO_CC+KEGG Pathways

KEGG Pathway Significant in both GSOA and GSEA:‘Caffeine Metabolism’ Pathway (hsa00232) (No.1 in both discovery set and validation set)

* 147 down-regulated overlaps  ‘Caffeine Metabolism’ (hsa00232) 
* Four genes involved: NAT2, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and XDH
* Highest FC: CYP2A6 (logFC = 3.4325; adjusted P-value = 6.35E-06)
* Narrowed-down hypothesis: CYP2A6  is down-regulated in HCC tissues as compared with non-cancerous liver tissues.

### Narrowed-down Hypothesis: in silico Validation 

CYP2A6 - Oncomine: liver vs HCC

* 5 related datasets
* 4/5: CYP2A6 is down-regulated in HCC 

<img src="/img/tutorial/8110/4503.png" alt="clinvar" align="center">

√ Narrowed-down hypothesis: CYP2A6 is down-regulated in HCC tissues as compared with non-cancerous liver tissues.

### Associations of CYP2A6 with Clinical Parameters

CYP2A6 - LinkedOmics: HCC patients

Down-regulation of CYP2A6 in HCC is associated with:

* Shorter overall survival time in a certain period (Cox Regression Test; Statistic = -4.801e-02; P-value = 2.409e-02; FDR(BH) = 7.227e-02)
* larger tumor size (Kruskal-Wallis Test; Statistic = 2.085e+01; P-value = 1.131e-04; FDR(BH) = 5.430e-04; except T4)
* more frequent regional lymph node metastasis (Wilcox Test; Statistic = -7.365e-01; P-value = 3.095e-02; FDR(BH) = 7.285e-02
* advanced overall pathological stage (Kruskal-Wallis Test; Statistic = 2.047e+01; P-value = 1.357e-04; FDR(BH) = 5.430e-04; except Stage IV)

**Down-regulation of CYP2A6  is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in HCC.**

### Biological Experiment Design

HCC vs non-cancerous liver tissues + medical records, Tissues: qPRC

CYP2A6  is down-regulated in HCC tissues as compared with non-cancerous liver tissues. CYP2A6 expression levels in HCC vs liver; ROC curve.

Down-regulation of CYP2A6  is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in HCC. CYP2A6 expression levels in different HCC patients; correlation tests with parameters. CYP2A6 expression levels + follow-up; survival curve (K-M; log-rank tests)
