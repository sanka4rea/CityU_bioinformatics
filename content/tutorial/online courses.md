### Online Courses
<p align="justify">There are many great **online learning platforms** that provide various elementary and advanced courses of R/Data science/R-packages. Most of those courses is free, but you can also choose some charged courses for specific needs or pay for a verified certificate of the courses.

## edx online courses
<p align="justify">[**edX**](https://www.edx.org/) is a free online course project jointly created by Harvard University and MIT. The purpose is to establish a joint education platform for the world's top universities, improve the quality of teaching, and promote online education online. At present, it has more than 900,000 registrants. The edX has added **15 world-renowned universities** including 6 Asian universities including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Hong Kong University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kyoto University in Japan and Seoul National University of Korea.

## Coursera online courses
<p align="justify">[**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/) was founded in 2012 by Stanford University computer science professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller. Ng and Koller were inspired by their experiences offering their Stanford courses online in fall 2011, and soon after left Stanford to launch Coursera. Princeton, Stanford, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania were the first universities to offer content on the platform. Offerings have since expanded to include Specializations – collections of courses that build skills in a specific subject – as well as degrees and a workforce development product for businesses and government organizations.

<p align="justify">Coursera works with universities and other organizations to offer online courses, specializations, and degrees in a variety of subjects, such as engineering, humanities, medicine, biology, social sciences, mathematics, business, computer science, digital marketing, data science, and others.
