      <description>In breast cancer, SMAD has rare mutation and weak capability of DNA binding, usually interact with other co-factors or transcription factors to bind to DNA.
Background  In breast cancer, SMAD has rare mutation and weak capability of DNA binding, usually interact with other co-factors or transcription factors to bind to DNA. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) plays dual role during tumor progression——tumor suppressor or tumor promoter. Identification of key signaling molecules or pathway related the switch TGFβ/SMAD signaling from tumor suppression to tumor promotion is important for the development of therapies for TGFβ associated signaling pathway.</description>

      <description>Esophageal carcinoma Esophageal carcinoma arising from the esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach.
Characteristics:  Common cancer: esophageal cancer was the eighth-most common cancer. Most common in China: half of all cancer cases occurring in China. Low survival rates: Five-year survival rates are around 13% to 18%.  The two main sub-types of the esophageal carcinoma:  Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)  Sample collection  Microarray Data</description>

      <description>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  Neoplastic disease which results from a mutation in a single lymphoid progenitor cell at one of several discrete stages of development B Cell or T Cell Most common childhood acute leukemia, ~80% Incidence in adults ~20% Bimodal distribution of occurrence: Peak at age 2-5 &amp;amp; Second augmented incidence after age 50  Pathogenesis Acquired Genetic Change in Chromosome
 Change in number, i.e., ploidy Change in structure Translocations (most common) Inversions Deletions Point mutations Amplifications Changes in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival  Significance of JQ1 treatment  JQ1 is a thienotriazolodiazepine and a prevailing inhibitor of the BET group of bromodomain proteins which incorporate BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and the testis-particular protein BRDT in vertebrates.</description>

      <description>Overview of ChIP-Seq analysis For ChIP-Seq, single-end (50bp) FASTQ reads were mapped to mouse genome mm10 (GRCm38, Dec/2011). Peaks 2,207 narrow peak regions and 2207 summits.
Motif discovery and Distribution of Sox4 binding sites by CEAS analysis Sox4 Target gene’s associated peaks prediction by BETA-minus analysis 1940 lines were identified using BETA-minus analysis in Galaxy/Cristrome. Among these 1940 lines and 1004 of them are located within promoter region (1000 bp upstream of TSS).</description>

      <description>Background  Ovarian cancer is a gynecological malignancy with the highest mortality rate. Patients lack specific symptoms in the early stage, patients present with Stage III or IV at initial diagnoses. Patients are often given cytoreductive surgery supplemented with platinum- and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy as standard frontline treatment. Prolonged treatment with chemotherapy often gives rise to multidrug resistance mechanisms including increase in detoxification, suppression of apoptotic signaling and stimulation of proliferation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Phytochemistry study of CP leaves
 -Flavonoids
 -Phenolic acids
 -Triterpenoids
 -Carbohydrates
 -Polysaccharides
  Terminology &amp;amp; Objective Metabolomics/Lipidomics
The metabolome represents the collection of all metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes. The metabolomics is the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles. In this study, we use lipidomics approach to specifically investigate lipids profiles under CP treatment.</description>

      <description>Background In humans, myocardial infarction (MI) causes irreversible cell loss and scarring and is a major source of morbidity and mortality.
Statistics show that each year about 870,000 new cases are diagnosed in the United States and about 50 percent of those diagnosed will die within five years (Mozaffarian et al. 2015).
Heart transplant is restricted for the short of donated hearts.
There still many technical and biological obstacles that restrict successful application of stem and progenitor cells approachs.</description>
