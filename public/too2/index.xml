      <description>Table of Contents  Transcription analysis Lipidomics Databases MS-based untargeted lipidomics MS-based targeted lipidomics   Transcription analysis Transcript abundance is in many ways an extraordinary phenotype, with special attributes that confer particular importance on an understanding of its genetics. The primary transformative potential of genome-wide gene expression genetics is the sheer number of traits — thousands — that can be assayed simultaneously.
Lipidomics Databases Development of databases and the related bioinformatics tools has become an essential part of the omics studies.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Nucleosome Positioning MNase-seq analysis ATAC-seq analysis  Find more tools: OMIVTOOLS    Nucleosome Positioning MNase-seq analysis The technology of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion combined with high-throughput sequencing (MNase-seq) is a powerful method to map the genome-wide distribution of nucleosome occupancy (Mavrich et al., 2008; Schones et al., 2008; Jiang and Pugh, 2009). Source text: Chen et al., 2014.
ATAC-seq analysis ATAC-seq allows simultaneous interrogation of factor occupancy, nucleosome positions in regulatory sites, and chromatin accessibility genome wide by considering the position of insertion and the distribution of insert lengths captured during the transposition reaction.</description>

Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins generally interact with the major groove of B-DNA, because it exposes more functional groups that identify a base pair.</description>
