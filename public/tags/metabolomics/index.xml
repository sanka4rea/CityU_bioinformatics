      <description>Table of Contents  Transcription analysis Lipidomics Databases MS-based untargeted lipidomics MS-based targeted lipidomics   Transcription analysis Transcript abundance is in many ways an extraordinary phenotype, with special attributes that confer particular importance on an understanding of its genetics. The primary transformative potential of genome-wide gene expression genetics is the sheer number of traits — thousands — that can be assayed simultaneously.
Lipidomics Databases Development of databases and the related bioinformatics tools has become an essential part of the omics studies.</description>
