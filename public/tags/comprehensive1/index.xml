      <description>Official Website
AJHG provides a record of research and review relating to heredity in humans and to the application of genetic principles in medicine and public policy, as well as in related areas of molecular and cell biology. Topics explored by AJHG include behavioral genetics, biochemical genetics, clinical genetics, cytogenetics, dysmorphology, gene therapy, genetic counseling, genetic epidemiology, genomics, immunogenetics, molecular genetics, neurogenetics, and population genetics.
AJHG welcomes submissions of articles and reports on timely subjects concerning all aspects of human genetics, including studies of model organisms that are of direct relevance to human genetics.</description>

Cancer Cell provides a high-profile forum to promote major advances in cancer research and oncology. The primary criterion for considering manuscripts is whether the studies provide major advances into answering important questions relevant to naturally occurring cancers. Cancer Cell particularly welcomes translational research.
Cancer Cell is also interested in publishing clinical investigations, in particular those that lead to establishing new paradigms in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of cancers; those that provide important insights into cancer biology beyond what has been revealed by preclinical studies; and those that are mechanism-based proof-of-principle clinical studies.</description>

      <description>Official Website
Cell publishes findings of unusual significance in any area of experimental biology, including but not limited to cell biology, molecular biology, neuroscience, immunology, virology and microbiology, cancer, human genetics, systems biology, signaling, and disease mechanisms and therapeutics. The basic criterion for considering papers is whether the results provide significant conceptual advances into, or raise provocative questions and hypotheses regarding, an interesting and important biological question. In addition to primary research articles in four formats, Cell features review and opinion articles on recent research advances and issues of interest to its broad readership in the Leading Edge section.</description>

Cell Research (CR) publishes original research results that are of unusual significance or broad conceptual or technical advances in all areas of life sciences, as long as the study is closely related to molecular and cell biology. The journal has an international authorship and a broad scope in basic research including:
 Cell growth, differentiation &amp;amp; apoptosis Signal transduction Stem cell biology &amp;amp; development Chromatin, epigenetics &amp;amp; transcription RNA biology Structural &amp;amp; molecular biology Cancer biology Immunity &amp;amp; molecular pathogenesis Molecular &amp;amp; cellular neuroscience Plant molecular &amp;amp; cell biology Genomics &amp;amp; proteomics  </description>

      <description>Official Website
Current Biology is a general journal that publishes original research across all areas of biology together with an extensive and varied set of editorial sections. A primary aim of the journal is to foster communication across fields of biology, both by publishing important findings of general interest from diverse fields and through highly accessible editorial articles that explicitly aim to inform non-specialists. Current Biology publishes papers reporting findings in any area of biology that have sufficient claim to be of general interestâ€”this could be, for example, because the advance is important for a specific field, or because it is intrinsically of wide interest to biologists generally.</description>

Launched in 1995, Genome Research is an international, continuously published, peer-reviewed journal that publishes studies on the structure, function, biology, and evolution of genomes of all organisms, with a long-standing emphasis on genome-scale analyses, chromatin structure and function, epigenomics, systems genetics, and proteomics. They also feature gene discoveries that provide novel insights and reports of high-throughput experimental and computational approaches.
In addition to these core areas, the journal is now particularly interested in the following areas: comprehensive characterization of genome sequence variation</description>
